## README 
API for topological analysis of protein packing (topProPack).

## TO-DO LIST
- Get API up-to-date with Anish's progress. 
- Provide directory of test .pdb's. 

## QUESTIONS
Residue class: 
- Does self.name refer to type of residue?
- self.atoms a list of atoms in residue?
- I am confused on difference between centroid and center of mass. What is your distinction?

atom class:
- How is element mass handled? How does element module work?
- What is preferred/necessary type for self.coords? Can it be a numpy array?
